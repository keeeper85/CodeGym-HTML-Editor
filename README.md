# CodeGym-HTML-Editor
Project at the end of level 29. A simple Swing-based editor for html files. 

Your HTML editor is ready!
You learned how to:
- Create applications with a graphical interface.
- Work with dialog boxes.
- Use classes from the Swing library.
- Implement interaction between program components with the help of events, listeners, and actions.
- You strengthened your knowledge of the MVC pattern.

Here are some things you might improve in the editor:
- Add a toolbar that replicates the functionality of the menu.
- Add highlighting of HTML tags on the second tab.
- Add the ability to load a document from the Internet.
- Expand the editor's capabilities (insert images, links, etc.)
